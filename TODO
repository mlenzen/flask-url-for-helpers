Where to store url_for_obj_mapping
	extensions is probably the wrong place, then we can't register the same extension
	to multiple apps
	Can't be on the app, we need to be able to register endpoints before an app is
	created.
how to store blueprint with render_func or inspect to get it without doing it explicitly
allow for missing attributes if not required for view
rename url_for_obj stuff. maybe register_type and url_from_type

testing
